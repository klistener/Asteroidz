## Download Project

To download the project files as a zip or tar file:

1. Open the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/klistener/Asteroidz) again in a separate tab, positioning this readme so you can still refer to it.

2. Select 'v0.0.0' from 'Releases':

If you are familiar with git and already have it installed, you can also just clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/klistener/Asteroidz.git
```

Return to Unity Hub, and click 'Projects'. Click on the 'Add' dropdown, and click 'Add project from disk'.
