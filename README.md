# Asteroidz

This repository contains a Unity project - the source code and configuration files for the game that you will be editing in this assignment. Follow these instructions to download the project.

## Install Unity

A specific version of Unity Editor (Unity 6.3 LTS) is needed to open this Unity project. To install it, you must first install a separate application called **Unity Hub**. Unity Hub is a utility for installing and managing different versions of Unity Editor. 

If you do not already have Unity Hub, go [here](https://unity.com/developer-tools?clickref=1110lNi66qt&utm_source=partnerize&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=unity_affiliate&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22883287084&gbraid=0AAAABA_4ouItrSaNIPt_9G9C4oSBfE7UL&gclid=CjwKCAiAjojLBhAlEiwAcjhrDu0RegHvmBmY4XKHNU7CYglS2S5cJ6jKJ4BphRXL6uaMhAY_qhv0QxoCaKcQAvD_BwE). Once the installation is complete, click on the 'Installs' page to the left...
